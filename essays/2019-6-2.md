## Coding Standards and the Never Ending Debate

After a week using IntelliJ and the ESLint coding standard, a programmer who has been told that in JavaScript that whitespace does not matter will throw a tantrum about ESLint errors being thrown when there is "too much blank lines at the end of the program." I really do not see any reason other than readibility is there a need for these kind of stylisic standards when deep down in the compilers and Assembly, it does not matter whatsoever if there is a space in between the function name and the parameter list open bracket. Then when I go and try to read other peoples code, especially new programmers first code where things are all over the place and comments are on the same line, but also on the next line, sometimes on the line below for whatever reason, variables are being created, but never used etc. I can see why enforcing a style of coding can help in a way, however all in all it does not matter.

## In the "beginnning", there was Imperative

Coming from the Computer Engineering side of things, one of the first languages I learned was C. I grew up using BASIC on my dads old Apple II and things were a bit shaky at first, but after leaning the syntax, my mind rushed back into the algorithmic thinking of programming games, or automizing certain long calculations that would take forever to with pencil and calculator. I would say that I am decentkly fluent in C, or at the very least have an advance knowledge of C and right now, the one thing that I have taken away and have "used" extensivley in my programs is tha fact that mmost languages will not care about whitespace. You can have a million lines between the function call and the first line of the function body, but the compiler will not care, the CPU will not care, the memory controller will not care. So I say, space away. 

Though with every rule, there has to be exceptions. And boy are there a lot of exceptions.

## The Inevitablability of Other Peoples Code

I believe there are few truths in programming: 1) the compiler is always right 2) the language is always right and 3) my code is the best and nobody can tell me otherwise. Whether we believe it or not, these truths hold. So it was a big surprise to me that someone would DARE tell me that you need at least one new line at the end of the program. 

One of the most horrendous things one can gaze upon is a beginners programer code. And that will extend to everyone.
