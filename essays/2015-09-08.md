## Is there such thing as a stupid question?

Coming from the engineering and hardware side of programming where each line of code is compiled into assembly instructions for hardware to interpret directly and having so much control over the hardware of the computer and having to deal with the fact that hardwar itself is "stupid," I scream heresy at languages like JavaScript. While I understand the need for such languages to exist since they are primarily used in a space (such as the web) where they are dealing with many different platforms and the need to be able to run on any one of them without the need to write a lengthy and effective compiler is great. However, it pains me when I am forced to make variables, and the way I see it that have a sort of in a superposition where the type of the variable is not strictly defined.
