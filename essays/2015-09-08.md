## Is there such thing as a stupid question?

Coming from the engineering and hardware side of programming where each line of code is compiled into assembly instructions for hardware to interpret directly and having so much control over the hardware of the computer and having to deal with the fact that hardwar itself is "stupid," I scream heresy at languages like JavaScript. While I understand the need for such languages to exist since they are primarily used in a space (such as the web) where they are dealing with many different platforms and the need to be able to run on any one of them without the need to write a lengthy and effective compiler is great. It pains me when I am forced to make variables, and the way I see it that have a sort of in a superposition where the type of the variable is not strictly defined. I can however appreciate that these languages are probably one of the better languages for complete beginners to learn and to study algorithms since there is no need t fiddle around with syntax errors, making sure that the pointers are pointing to where they need to be, or freeing up memory that was dynamically allocated after that memory block has served its purpose. Especially as someone who is the TA for the C++ lab and having students that have very little or no programming skills at all jump straight into a language that has a significant amount of nuance to design and a ton of tools avaliable that can come crashing down if you do not know what you are doing. For me however, I can say it is a cute little heretic language that does not like committing to a paradigm.
