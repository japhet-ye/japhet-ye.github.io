One of the big mantras of learning is that there are no stupid questions. This is usually framed as a way to develop a habit for students to actually start asking questions instead if blankly nodding with no input to a lecture. However, within the context of a technical field (and with some experience myself), the fact of the matter is that there are stupid questions that a quick web search or a minute of reflecting can solve.

When it comes to teaching, teachers want feedback from the students so they can clarify on things that might cause confusion. So a simple question like "what's the difference between ionic and covalnet bonds" is a valid question even though we just went over that question for the past 20 minutes. This gives the teacher an opportunity to further expand on the subject on hand and futher engages the students. However, if you ask "how big is an integer again?" in a CPU design course during the lecture on the different approaches to memory managemnet, then you are wasting everyones time. There is a correct time, place, and way to ask a question. Whether it is a deep thought provoking  technical question or a simple syntax question, there is a time, place, and way to ask those things.

## From a teaching perspective

From experience, I want people to ask smart questions, or at least appropriate questions. It is appropriate to ask "what is the syntax of constrtuctors" when first learning about the various implicit functions of objects; it is not appropriate to ask "how do you declare a function" when learning about how imperative languages like C uses the head to dynamically store certain variables. Yet I, as a teaching assistant, do not have the luxury of having people who ask smart questions or even ask questions at all when I am going over relevant material. So that initial thought of "there are no stupid questions" is completely thrown out when I am getting no questions. It is also very bad when I see some of the students code, uncompilable, brute force random permutation garbage with minimal comments on their thought process. 

I beleive smart questions are useful for both parties, but in practice and in a traditional teaching enviorment getting any questions at all is a blessing and can give further insight to what the students know to curtail lecture to go over the more complicated bits.
